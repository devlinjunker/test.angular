//  * This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
//  * You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.
//  *
//  * This file is divided into 2 sections:
//  *   1. Browser polyfills. These are applied before loading ZoneJS and are sorted by browsers.
//  *   2. Application imports. Files imported after ZoneJS that should be loaded before your main
//  *      file.
//  *
//  * The current setup is for so-called "evergreen" browsers; the last _versions of browsers that
//  * automatically update themselves. This includes Safari >= 10, Chrome >= 55 (including Opera),
//  * Edge >= 13 on the desktop, and iOS 10 and Chrome on mobile.
//  *
//  * Learn more in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html
